Followings are instructions for training process

1. There are 3 different python script and these should be run in order.

2. Before running, you need to install necessary libraries and python 3:

- sklearn
- xgboost
- shap

3. Firstly, you need to create input and label vectors by using PrepareInputVectors.py this step read all training data files and create vectors

$ python PrepareInputVectors.py

3.1. You need to enter the path of your data directory

4. Secondly, you need to select best features by using Xgboost and Shap values. After this step best features can be found in tfeatures/Features.txt file.

$ python featureSelection.py

5. Finally, you need to train a SVM model by using these features and input vectors. After this step necessary coef.csv and rho.csv files can be found in modelCoef/ directory. 

$ python modelSVM.py
